            About me
        </h1>
        <p>
            I was born in the UK, and although I later moved back to the UK, it's always felt like home to me. I come from a big family—I'm one of seven sisters.
            Two of them live with me, two are happily married, and the other two are living in another country. Despite the distance, we're all very close and supportive of one another.
            During my high school and college years, I was passionate about dancing and singing. Performing gave me a sense of freedom and joy, and it really helped shape my creative side. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I still carry that love for creativity in everything I do—whether it’s organizing my space, working on a project, or simply adding a personal touch to everyday tasks.
            I’ve always enjoyed helping others. There's something incredibly fulfilling about being there for people when they need support, whether emotionally, practically, or just lending a hand.
        </p>
          <p> I believe in kindness and making a positive difference in the lives of those around me.When I have some free time, I like to cook. Experimenting with new recipes or making comfort food is something I genuinely enjoy. I also find cleaning quite therapeutic—it gives me a sense of calm and control.
            Overall, I’m someone who values creativity, compassion, and connection. I love expressing myself, staying productive, and being a supportive presence in the lives of others.
